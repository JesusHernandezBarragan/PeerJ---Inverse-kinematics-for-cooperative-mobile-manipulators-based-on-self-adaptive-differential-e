# PeerJ---Inverse-kinematics-for-cooperative-mobile-manipulators-based-on-self-adaptive-differential-e
Inverse kinematics for cooperative mobile manipulators based on self-adaptive differential evolution

The main script to run the simulations is
Main_RUN.m

To run the considered methods individually for cooperative mobile manipulation, please run
BBPSO.m
CFPSO.m
FPA.m
IDE.m

The results from simulations are given in the folder named _Results. 
Please run the JointMotion.m and Tracking.m scripts to obtain the results presented in graphs. 
To get the results in tables, please run the script named Tables.m.

Note: The files were created with MATLAB R2017a. It is convenient to provide the Raw data in MAT format. 
MAT files contain variables and data necessary to run the simulation files.
